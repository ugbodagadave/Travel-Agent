# AI Travel Agent

This project is an AI-powered travel agent accessible via WhatsApp and Telegram. It uses natural language processing to understand user requests, search for real-time flight information, and book flights. It is deployed as a single, multi-threaded web service on Render.

## Current Features
- **Multi-Platform Support**: Communicates with users via the Twilio API for WhatsApp and the Telegram Bot API.
- **Natural Language Understanding**: Leverages the IO Intelligence API to understand conversations, manage a state machine (e.g., `GATHERING_INFO`, `FLIGHT_SELECTION`), and extract structured data like destinations, dates, and traveler details.
- **Live Flight Search**: Integrates with the Amadeus Self-Service API to search for real-time flight offers based on the user's criteria.
- **Airline Name Display**: Looks up and displays the full airline name (e.g., "American Airlines") for each flight option, providing a clearer user experience.
- **Payment Processing**: Creates secure Stripe Checkout links. After a successful payment, it generates a PDF itinerary and sends it to the user.
- **Persistent State**: Maintains conversation state for each user in a Redis database.
- **Responsive Architecture**: Long-running tasks like flight searches are run in background threads, so the main application is never blocked.

## Core Technologies
- **Programming Language:** Python 3.11
- **Web Framework:** Flask
- **Deployment:** Render
- **Platform Integration:** Twilio (WhatsApp), Telegram Bot API
- **AI Conversation Layer:** IO Intelligence API
- **Flight Data API:** Amadeus Self-Service APIs
- **Payment Processing API:** Stripe
- **Session Storage:** Render Redis
- **Testing**: Pytest

## How It Works

This application runs as a **single web service** on Render.

It's a Flask application that handles incoming webhooks from Twilio and Telegram. To ensure the service is always responsive, it processes messages, manages conversation state, and runs long-running tasks in background threads. After a user completes a payment via a Stripe webhook, the application generates a PDF of the flight itinerary and sends it back to the user on their messaging platform. User session data is stored in a connected Render Redis instance.

This single-service, multi-threaded architecture simplifies deployment while maintaining a great user experience.

## Current Status & Limitations
**Please Note:** This application is currently configured for sandbox testing. The final step of booking a flight with the Amadeus API after payment is **intentionally not yet implemented**. This is because real flight booking requires a production environment. The current post-payment flow focuses on generating and sending a mock itinerary for testing purposes.

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ugbodagadave/Travel-Agent
    cd Travel-Agent
    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set Up Environment Variables:**
    Create a file named `.env` in the project root and add the following variables.

    ```
    # Twilio API Credentials (for WhatsApp)
    TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=
    TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=
    TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=

    # Telegram Bot API Credentials
    TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=

    # IO Intelligence API Key
    IO_API_KEY=

    # Amadeus API Credentials
    AMADEUS_CLIENT_ID=
    AMADEUS_CLIENT_SECRET=

    # Stripe API Keys
    STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
    STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=
    STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=

    # Redis URL (for local development)
    # On Render, this is set automatically. For local, you might use:
    REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379

    # The base URL of the deployed application (e.g., https://your-app.onrender.com)
    # This is required for creating correct Stripe redirect URLs.
    BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:5000
    ```

    **How to get the API keys:**
    - **Twilio**: Create a Twilio account and get your `Account SID`, `Auth Token`, and a Twilio phone number from the console.
    - **Telegram**: Create a new bot by talking to the `@BotFather` on Telegram. It will give you a `Bot Token`.
    - **IO Intelligence**: Create an account on the IO Intelligence platform and generate an API key.
    - **Amadeus**: Register for a Self-Service account on the Amadeus for Developers portal to get your `Client ID` and `Client Secret`.
    - **Stripe**: Sign up for a Stripe account and find your `Publishable Key`, `Secret Key`, and `Webhook Secret` in the Developers dashboard.
    - **Redis**: For local development, you need to run a Redis server. On Render, the `REDIS_URL` is automatically provided to the service.

## Running Tests
To ensure everything is configured correctly, run the test suite:
```bash
pytest -sv
```

## Running Locally
To run the application locally, you just need to start the web server. Make sure you have a local Redis instance running first.

```bash
gunicorn app.main:app
```

## Deployment
This application is designed for easy deployment to **Render** using the `render.yaml` file.

1.  Push your code to a GitHub repository.
2.  In the Render Dashboard, create a new "Blueprint" and connect your repository.
3.  Render will automatically detect `render.yaml` and create the `web` service and the `redis` instance.
4.  Add all the secret environment variables from your `.env` file to the service's "Environment" tab in the Render UI.
5.  Update your Twilio and Telegram webhooks to point to your new Render service URL.
