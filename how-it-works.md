# How the AI Travel Agent Works: A Deep Dive

This document provides a detailed, step-by-step explanation of how the entire system works. The application is built on a **single-service architecture** that uses background threading to ensure it is responsive, scalable, and resilient.

### High-Level Architecture

The application is a single, robust **Flask web service**. It's designed to handle all user interactions, from receiving initial messages to sending final confirmations.

To prevent long-running operations (like searching for flights) from blocking the application, these tasks are executed in a **separate background thread**. This ensures the main web service is always available to respond instantly to new user messages.

**Redis** is used as a fast, in-memory database to store each user's conversation state, allowing for seamless, multi-turn dialogues.

This single-service, multi-threaded architecture simplifies deployment and maintenance while preserving a highly responsive user experience.

### The Step-by-Step User Journey

Let's walk through the exact sequence of events as a user interacts with the agent.

#### Step 1: The Initial Handshake

1.  **User Sends Message:** A user sends "Hi" to the Telegram Bot.
2.  **Platform Webhook:** Telegram makes an HTTP `POST` request to the public URL of the **Web Service**.
3.  **Application Entry Point (`app/main.py`):** The Flask server receives the request. The `/telegram-webhook` function extracts the user's ID and message and passes them to the central `process_message` function in `app/core_logic.py`.

#### Step 2: Core Logic and State Management

This all happens inside the `process_message` function in `app/core_logic.py`.

1.  **Session Loading (`app/new_session_manager.py`):** The function immediately calls `load_session(user_id)` to fetch the user's conversation state from **Redis**. If the user is new, it creates a new session with the state `GATHERING_INFO`.

2.  **AI Processing (`app/ai_service.py`):** Based on the current state, `get_ai_response` is called. It sends the conversation history to the **IO Intelligence API**, which asks clarifying questions until it has all the details (origin, destination, date, etc.). When complete, the AI returns the special tag `[INFO_COMPLETE]`.

3.  **State Transition & Session Saving:** The web service sees the `[INFO_COMPLETE]` tag, transitions the user's state to `AWAITING_CONFIRMATION`, and saves the updated session back to **Redis**. The confirmation summary is sent back to the user as an immediate HTTP response.

#### Step 3: The Asynchronous Handoff (The Background Thread)

This is the most critical part of the architecture.

1.  **User Confirms:** The user replies "Yes". The web service receives this message.
2.  **Task Dispatching (`app/core_logic.py`):**
    *   The `process_message` function loads the session and sees the state is `AWAITING_CONFIRMATION`.
    *   It immediately sends the user the message "Okay, I'm searching for the best flights..."
    *   Crucially, it **does not** search for flights in the main request thread. Instead, it starts a new background thread using Python's built-in `threading` module to run the `search_flights_task` function.
    *   The web service's job is now complete for this request, and it returns an immediate `200 OK` response to Telegram.

#### Step 4: Background Flight Search

1.  **Independent Execution (`app/tasks.py`):**
    *   Meanwhile, the `search_flights_task` function runs independently in its own thread.
2.  **Execution:** The task's code executes:
    *   It calls the Amadeus API to get IATA codes.
    *   It calls the Amadeus API again to perform the live flight search. This can take several seconds without affecting the main application.
    *   For each flight offer returned, it makes an additional call to the Amadeus API to look up the full airline name from its `carrierCode`.
3.  **Proactive Response:**
    *   Once the search is complete, the background thread formats the flight offers into a user-friendly list, now including the airline name.
    *   It then connects directly to the Telegram API and sends the results as a **new, proactive message** to the user.
4.  **Final State Update:** The thread updates the user's state in Redis to `FLIGHT_SELECTION` and saves the flight offers to their session.

#### Step 5: Payment Confirmation and Itinerary Delivery

The final part of the user journey is handled by the Stripe webhook.

1.  **Payment Success:** The user successfully completes the payment on the Stripe Checkout page.
2.  **Stripe Webhook (`app/main.py`):** Stripe sends a `checkout.session.completed` event to the `/stripe-webhook` endpoint.
3.  **PDF Generation:** The webhook handler loads the user's session, retrieves the flight offer they paid for, and uses the `pdf_service` to generate a flight itinerary PDF.
4.  **Proactive Delivery:**
    *   The PDF is sent directly to the user on Telegram or WhatsApp.
    *   A final confirmation message is sent.
    *   The user's state is updated to `BOOKING_CONFIRMED`.

### Production Considerations: Handling PDF Files

**IMPORTANT:** The current method for sending PDFs on WhatsApp is designed for **testing and local development only**.

*   **Current Test Implementation:** The application saves the PDF to a local `temp_files` directory on the server and serves it via a special `/files/<filename>` endpoint. This works for a single, local server but is not suitable for a real-world deployment.

*   **Why This Fails in Production:**
    *   **Ephemeral Filesystem:** Hosting platforms like Render use ephemeral filesystems. Any files written to the local disk (like our PDFs) will be **permanently deleted** every time the service restarts or redeploys.
    *   **Not Scalable:** If the application were scaled to run on multiple instances, a request for a file would only succeed if it hit the specific server instance that generated it.

*   **Recommended Production Architecture:**
    1.  **Use Cloud Storage:** Integrate a dedicated cloud storage service like **Amazon S3**, **Google Cloud Storage**, or **Cloudinary**.
    2.  **Direct Upload:** When the `pdf_service` generates the PDF, instead of saving it locally, upload the file bytes directly to your cloud storage bucket.
    3.  **Use Public URL:** The cloud storage service will provide a stable, publicly accessible URL for the uploaded file.
    4.  **Send to Twilio:** Use this permanent public URL as the `media_url` when calling the Twilio API.

This approach ensures that files are persisted reliably and can be accessed from anywhere, which is essential for a scalable and robust production application.
