How the AI Travel Agent Works: A Simple Guide

This document explains the workflow of the AI Travel Agent from a user's perspective, focusing on the technologies that make it possible.

### The Conversation Flow

**1. You Send a Message**
It all starts when you send a message to the agent on **WhatsApp** or **Telegram**.
*   **Technology Used:** The **Twilio API** and **Telegram Bot API** securely forward your message to our application's "front desk."

**2. The AI Understands Your Request**
Our application's front desk talks to an AI "brain" to understand what you want. The AI figures out the key details like your destination, origin, and travel dates. If it's missing a detail, it will ask a clarifying question.
*   **Technology Used:** The **IO Intelligence API** provides the powerful natural language understanding.

**3. Finding Your Flight in the Background**
Once you've confirmed your trip details, the front desk immediately sends you a message like "Okay, I'm searching..." and then starts looking for flights in the background. This ensures the agent is always fast and responsive. A moment later, the agent sends you the best options it found in a new message.
*   **Technology Used:** The **Amadeus API** provides real-time flight data, and the application uses a background **threading** process to find it without slowing down the main chat.

**4. You Choose and Pay**
The agent sends you the flight options as a simple, numbered list. When you reply with the number you want, you'll be asked if you want to pay with a **Card**, **USDC** (a type of cryptocurrency), or **On-chain**.
*   **If you choose "Card"**: The system generates a secure payment link for you.
*   **If you choose "USDC"**: The system gives you a unique crypto address to send your payment to.
*   **If you choose "On-chain"**: The system gives you a unique blockchain address to send 1 CLAYER (native token) to.
*   **Technology Used:** The **Stripe API** handles card payments, the **Circle API** handles USDC payments, and **Circle Layer blockchain** handles native CLAYER token payments.

**5. Booking is Confirmed... Automatically!**
After you complete the payment, the application confirms it and generates your ticket.
*   **For Card Payments:** The app receives an instant notification from **Stripe Webhooks**.
*   **For USDC Payments:** The app now uses a reliable **polling** method. It automatically checks with the **Circle API** every 30 seconds until your payment is confirmed on the blockchain.
*   This means you get your ticket promptly without relying on potentially delayed webhooks.

**6. You Get Your Ticket**
The moment the booking is confirmed, you receive a final message on WhatsApp or Telegram with your flight itinerary as a PDF.

### How Does It Remember Me?

The agent can have conversations with many users at once and never gets confused. This is because it saves the context of your specific conversation in a fast, in-memory database.
*   **Technology Used:** A **Redis** database (hosted on Render) securely stores your conversation history, so you can even pause and come back later without starting over.

### Reliability & Error Handling

The system is designed to be reliable and provide a good experience even when things go wrong:

*   **Smart Error Handling:** If there are technical issues, the agent provides helpful responses instead of generic error messages
*   **Graceful Failures:** The system continues working even if some components are temporarily unavailable
*   **Comprehensive Monitoring:** Detailed logging and health checks ensure issues are quickly identified and resolved
*   **User-Friendly:** You'll always get a meaningful response, even during technical difficulties
