How the AI Travel Agent Works: A Simple Guide

This document explains the workflow of the AI Travel Agent from a user's perspective, focusing on the technologies that make it possible.

### The Conversation Flow

**1. You Send a Message**
It all starts when you send a message to the agent on **WhatsApp** or **Telegram**.
*   **Technology Used:** The **Twilio API** and **Telegram Bot API** securely forward your message to our application's "front desk."

**2. The AI Understands Your Request**
Our application's front desk talks to an AI "brain" to understand what you want. The AI figures out the key details like your destination, origin, and travel dates. If it's missing a detail, it will ask a clarifying question.
*   **Technology Used:** The **IO Intelligence API** provides the powerful natural language understanding.

**3. Finding Your Flight in the Background**
Once you've confirmed your trip details, the front desk immediately sends you a message like "Okay, I'm searching..." and then starts looking for flights in the background. This ensures the agent is always fast and responsive. A moment later, the agent sends you the best options it found in a new message.
*   **Technology Used:** The **Amadeus API** provides real-time flight data, and the application uses a background **threading** process to find it without slowing down the main chat.

**4. You Choose and Pay**
The agent sends you the flight options as a simple, numbered list. When you reply with the number of the flight you want, the system generates a secure payment link for you.
*   **Technology Used:** The **Stripe API** creates a secure, hosted checkout page.

**5. Booking is Confirmed... Automatically!**
After you complete the payment, Stripe sends an automatic notification back to our application. Once our app receives this signal, it asks for your final details (like your full name) and then automatically books your selected flight.
*   **Technology Used:** **Stripe Webhooks** send the payment confirmation, and the **Amadeus API** is used again to make the final booking.

**6. You Get Your Confirmation**
The moment the booking is complete, you receive a final message on WhatsApp or Telegram with your booking ID.

### How Does It Remember Me?

The agent can have conversations with many users at once and never gets confused. This is because it saves the context of your specific conversation in a fast, in-memory database.
*   **Technology Used:** A **Redis** database (hosted on Render) securely stores your conversation history, so you can even pause and come back later without starting over.
