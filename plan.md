# AI Travel Agent: Step-by-Step Build Plan

This document outlines the development plan for the AI Travel Agent project. We will follow a test-driven development (TDD) approach for each feature.

**Development Workflow:**
1.  **Create/Update Feature:** Implement a new piece of functionality.
2.  **Write Tests:** Create unit and integration tests for the new feature.
3.  **Run Tests:** Execute the test suite to ensure the new feature works as expected and doesn't break existing code.
4.  **Fix Errors:** If tests fail, debug and fix the code.
5.  **Repeat:** Continue running tests until all pass, then move to the next feature.

## Phase 0: Project Setup

### Feature/Build
- Initialize the project structure, version control, and virtual environment.

### Implementation Steps
1.  Create the main project directory.
2.  Initialize a Git repository: `git init`
3.  Create a Python virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
4.  Activate the virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate` (on Unix) or `venv\Scripts\activate` (on Windows).
5.  Create initial project folders: `app`, `tests`.
6.  Create an empty `__init__.py` in both folders.
7.  Install `pytest`: `pip install pytest`
8.  Create `.gitignore` to exclude `venv`, `__pycache__`, `.env`, etc.

## Phase 1: Basic Web Server and WhatsApp Webhook

### Feature/Build
- A basic Flask web server with a `/webhook` endpoint that can receive POST requests.

### Tests
- Create `tests/test_app.py`.
- Write a test that sends a POST request to `/webhook` and asserts a `200 OK` response.

### Implementation Steps
1.  **Install Flask:** `pip install Flask`
2.  **Create `app/main.py`:**
    - Import `Flask`.
    - Create a Flask app instance.
    - Define a `/webhook` route that accepts `POST` requests.
    - The route should return a simple "OK" message with a 200 status code for now.

### Testing
- Run `pytest` from the root directory.

---

## Phase 2: Twilio Integration

### Feature/Build
- Receive and parse incoming WhatsApp messages from Twilio.
- Send a simple, static reply back to the user via Twilio.

### Tests
- Mock the Twilio request object.
- Write a test to ensure the `/webhook` correctly parses the `From` and `Body` from a simulated Twilio POST request.
- Write a test to assert that the endpoint returns a valid TwiML response to send a message.

### Implementation Steps
1.  **Install Twilio SDK:** `pip install twilio`
2.  **Credential Prompt:** I will now ask you for your **Twilio Account SID** and **Auth Token**. Please have them ready. We will store them in a `.env` file for local development.
3.  **Update `/webhook`:**
    - Import `MessagingResponse` from `twilio.rest`.
    - Modify the endpoint to read the incoming message body.
    - Create a TwiML response to send a reply (e.g., "Message received!").
    - Return the TwiML response as an XML string.
4.  Install `python-dotenv` to manage environment variables: `pip install python-dotenv`. Load variables in `main.py`.

### Testing
- Run `pytest`.

---

## Phase 3: IO Intelligence for Basic Conversation

### Feature/Build
- Pass the user's message to the IO Intelligence Chat Completion API and return the AI's response.

### Tests
- Mock the IO Intelligence API client.
- Write a test that verifies the webhook sends the received message to the IO API.
- Write a test that asserts the webhook correctly formats and returns the response from the mocked IO API.

### Implementation Steps
1.  **Install IO SDK:** I will search for the correct SDK and install it.
2.  **Credential Prompt:** I will now ask you for your **IO Intelligence API Key**.
3.  **Create an IO client:**
    - Create a new module, e.g., `app/ai_service.py`.
    - Write a function that takes a user message, sends it to the IO Chat Completion API, and returns the response.
4.  **Update `/webhook`:**
    - Call the new AI service function with the message body.
    - Use the AI's response in the TwiML reply.

### Testing
- Run `pytest`.

---

## Phase 4: Conversation Logic and Slot-Filling

### Feature/Build
- Use the IO Intelligence Agents API to extract structured data (slots) from user messages, such as origin, destination, and dates.

### Tests
- Write tests for the slot-filling logic with various inputs:
    - A message with all required information.
    - A message with partial information.
    - A message with ambiguous information.
- Assert that the correct slots are extracted or that the agent asks appropriate clarifying questions.

### Implementation Steps
1.  **Design Agent Instructions:** Define a clear set of instructions for the IO Agent on how to extract flight details.
2.  **Update `ai_service.py`:**
    - Create a new function to interact with the IO Agents API.
    - This function will manage the conversation flow, passing the user message and current state to the agent.
3.  **Update `/webhook`:**
    - Replace the call to the chat completion API with a call to the new agent service.

### Testing
- Run `pytest`.

---

## Phase 5: Session Persistence with Redis

### Feature/Build
- Store and retrieve the conversation state for each user, allowing for multi-turn conversations.

### Tests
- Write a test to verify that after a message is processed, the user's session state (e.g., filled slots) is saved to a mocked Redis instance.
- Write a test to verify that on a new message from an existing user, their previous state is loaded correctly.

### Implementation Steps
1.  **Install Redis:** `pip install redis`
2.  **Set up Redis on Render:** I will guide you through setting up a free Redis instance on Render to get the connection URL.
3.  **Create `app/session_manager.py`:**
    - Implement functions to `save_session` and `load_session` using the user's WhatsApp number as the key.
4.  **Update `/webhook`:**
    - Before calling the AI service, load the user's session.
    - After receiving the AI's response, save the updated session state.

### Testing
- Run `pytest`.

---

## Phase 6: Timezone Handling

### Feature/Build
- Infer the user's timezone from the origin city to handle dates and times correctly.

### Tests
- Write a test to check if a city name (e.g., "Paris") is correctly mapped to its timezone (e.g., "Europe/Paris").
- Write a test for the fallback mechanism when a timezone cannot be determined.

### Implementation Steps
1.  **Install pytz:** `pip install pytz`
2.  **Implement Timezone Logic:**
    - Create a helper function that takes a city name and returns a timezone.
3.  **Integrate with Slot-Filling:**
    - After the origin city is extracted, call the timezone helper.
    - Store the timezone in the user's session.

### Testing
- Run `pytest`.

---

## Phase 7: Flight Search Integration

### Feature/Build
- Once all necessary slots are filled, query a flight search API and return the results.

### Tests
- Mock the flight search API.
- Write a test to ensure that once the conversation is complete, the collected slot data is used to call the flight search API with the correct parameters.
- Write a test to ensure the flight API's JSON response is parsed and formatted into a user-friendly string for WhatsApp.

### Implementation Steps
1.  **Choose and Register for API:** We'll start with the Skyscanner API as per the PRD.
2.  **Credential Prompt:** I will ask you for your **Skyscanner API Key**.
3.  **Create `app/flight_service.py`:**
    - Implement a function to call the flight search API with the trip details.
    - Implement a function to format the results.
4.  **Update Conversation Flow:**
    - In the main logic, once all slots are filled, call the flight search service.
    - Send the formatted flight options back to the user.

### Testing
- Run `pytest`.

## Phase 8: Deployment to Render

### Feature/Build
- Prepare the application for deployment on a live server.

### Implementation Steps
1.  **Create `requirements.txt`:** `pip freeze > requirements.txt`
2.  **Create `render.yaml`:** Define the web service, database (Redis), build commands, and start commands.
3.  **Configure Gunicorn:** Install `gunicorn` and set the start command in `render.yaml` to `gunicorn app.main:app`.
4.  **GitHub and Render Setup:**
    - I will instruct you to push the code to a new GitHub repository.
    - I will guide you on creating a new Web Service on Render and linking it to your GitHub repo.
5.  **Environment Variables:** I will instruct you on how to add all the API keys and secrets (`TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`, `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`, `IO_API_KEY`, `SKYSCANNER_API_KEY`, `REDIS_URL`) to the Render environment.
6.  **Final Webhook Configuration:** Update the Twilio WhatsApp Sandbox webhook URL to point to your live Render application URL.

### Testing
- Manually send a message to your Twilio WhatsApp number to perform an end-to-end test of the live application.
